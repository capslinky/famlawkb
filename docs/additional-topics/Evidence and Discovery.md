A: Courts can impose sanctions including attorney fees, evidence preclusion, or adverse inferences against non-compliant parties.

**Q: How do I preserve text messages for discovery?**

**Q: Can I record conversations with my spouse?**
A: Arizona allows one-party consent recording, but federal law may apply to interstate calls, and admissibility varies.
