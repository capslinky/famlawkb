# Paternity and Parentage

## üîç Quick Overview
Establishing legal parentage is crucial for determining rights and responsibilities regarding children born outside of marriage. Arizona law provides multiple pathways to establish paternity, including voluntary acknowledgment, genetic testing, and court adjudication. Once established, fathers have equal rights to custody and equal obligations for support.
