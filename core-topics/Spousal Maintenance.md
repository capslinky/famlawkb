# Spousal Maintenance (Alimony)

## üîç At a Glance

**Quick Summary**: Spousal maintenance (alimony) provides financial support from one spouse to another after divorce. Unlike child support, there's no formula - judges decide based on need and ability to pay.

**Who This Affects**: Lower-earning spouses who can't meet reasonable needs through property or employment. Common after long marriages or when one spouse sacrificed career for family.

**Key Point**: Must first prove eligibility, then court decides amount and duration.

## ‚ö° Key Takeaways

- ‚úÖ Must prove eligibility before amount/duration
- ‚úÖ No formula - judge has full discretion
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tax rules changed in 2019 (not deductible)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remarriage ends it automatically
- üìä Average duration: 30-50% of marriage length
- üí∞ Common amounts: 15-25% of income difference
- üîÑ Can be modified if circumstances change

## üéØ Do I Qualify?

### Must Meet ONE of These (A.R.S. ¬ß 25-319)

**1. Not Enough Property** üìä
- Your share of assets won't cover reasonable needs
- Includes what you're getting in divorce
- Looking at monthly income from assets

**2. Can't Support Yourself** üíº
- No appropriate job available
- Health problems limit work
- Skills outdated or never developed
- Not just "don't want to work"

**3. Caring for Young Child** üë∂
- Child's needs require you home
- Special needs situations
- Daycare not appropriate/available

**4. Helped Spouse's Career** üéì
- Put them through school
- Supported their business
- Gave up your career
- Moved for their job

**5. Long Marriage + Older Age** ‚è∞
- Married 15+ years
- Age 50+ typically
- Limited work history
- Can't realistically start career

**6. Lost Earning Ability** üìâ
- Stayed home with kids
- Gave up promotions
- Part-time only for family
- Now can't catch up

### What You Need to Prove

**Documents Required**:
- Financial affidavit (income/expenses)
- Work history/resume
- Medical records if disabled
- Education transcripts
- Expert evaluation (sometimes)

**Key Point**: Just needing money isn't enough - must fit a category above!

## üí∞ Types of Support

### Temporary Support (During Divorce)

**What**: Monthly payments while case pending

**How Long**: Until final decree (60 days - 2+ years)

**Amount**: Based on maintaining status quo

**Get It By**: Filing motion with financial affidavit

### Rehabilitative Support (Most Common)

**What**: Help becoming self-supporting

**How Long**: Usually 2-5 years

**Examples**:
- Finish college degree
- Get job training/certification  
- Re-enter workforce
- Start a business

**May Extend If**: Making good faith efforts but need more time

### Compensatory Support

**What**: Payback for career sacrifices

**When Used**:
- You put spouse through school
- Moved repeatedly for their job
- Stayed home so they could work
- Helped build their business

**Duration**: Often longer than rehabilitative

### Permanent Support (Rare)

**Requirements**:
- Very long marriage (20+ years)
- Traditional roles throughout
- Too old/sick to work
- Never going to be self-sufficient

**Note**: "Permanent" still ends at remarriage/death

### Hybrid Arrangements

**Stepped-Down**:
- Year 1: $3,000/month
- Year 2: $2,000/month  
- Year 3: $1,000/month
- Then ends

**Review Date**:
- Support for 3 years
- Then court reviews need
- May continue or end

## üìä How Much & How Long?

### Amount Determination

**No Formula But Common Approaches**:

**1. Needs-Based** (Most Common)
```
Your reasonable monthly expenses     $5,000
- Your income after divorce         -$2,000
- Income from property              -$500
= Potential maintenance             $2,500
```

**2. Income Equalization**
- Add both incomes together
- Divide by 2
- Higher earner pays difference
- Adjust for child support

**3. Percentage Guidelines** (Informal)
- 15-25% of income difference
- 20-30% of payor's gross
- Varies by county/judge

### Duration Guidelines

**Rules of Thumb** (Not Law):

| Marriage Length | Support Duration |
|----------------|------------------|
| Under 5 years | 0-2 years |
| 5-10 years | 2-4 years |
| 10-15 years | 3-7 years |
| 15-20 years | 5-10 years |
| 20+ years | 10+ or permanent |

**Factors That Increase Duration**:
- Older age (50+)
- Health problems
- No work history
- Caring for disabled child

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Short Marriage**
```
Married: 4 years
Wife: Teacher $40,000/year
Husband: Engineer $90,000/year
No kids

Likely: $1,000-1,500/month for 2 years
```

**Example 2: Long Marriage**
```
Married: 25 years
Wife: Homemaker, no income
Husband: Doctor $200,000/year
Kids grown

Likely: $5,000-7,000/month indefinitely
```

### The 13 Factors Courts Consider

1. **Marital lifestyle** - Not guaranteed to continue
2. **Length of marriage** - Longer = more support
3. **Age/health** - Affects ability to work
4. **Work history** - Gaps matter
5. **Earning ability** - Current and potential
6. **Property received** - Income-producing?
7. **Contributions** - To spouse's career
8. **Sacrifices made** - For family
9. **Time to train** - For employment
10. **Ability to pay** - After own needs
11. **Marital waste** - Gambling, affairs
12. **Insurance costs** - Especially health
13. **Domestic violence** - Financial impact

## üîÑ The Process

### Step 1: Request in Divorce Papers

**In Your Petition/Response**:
- ‚òëÔ∏è Check box requesting spousal maintenance
- ‚òëÔ∏è Don't specify amount (decided later)
- ‚òëÔ∏è Can't add after decree without agreement

### Step 2: Financial Disclosure

**Both Parties Provide**:
- Affidavit of Financial Information
- Tax returns (3 years)
- Pay stubs (6 months)
- Bank statements
- Monthly expense list
- Debt documentation

### Step 3: Temporary Support

**If Needed During Divorce**:
1. File motion for temporary orders
2. Attach financial affidavit
3. Hearing within 30-60 days
4. Order until final decree

### Step 4: Build Your Case

**Gather Evidence**:
- Employment history
- Education records
- Medical documentation
- Career sacrifice proof
- Standard of living evidence
- Future expense projections

**Consider Experts**:
- Vocational evaluator
- Financial planner
- Medical professionals

### Step 5: Negotiate or Trial

**Settlement (90% of cases)**:
- Exchange proposals
- Mediation often helps
- Creative solutions possible
- Faster and cheaper

**Trial (10% of cases)**:
- Present evidence
- Expert testimony
- Judge decides all terms
- Detailed findings required

## üíµ Tax Impact

### Current Rules (2019 & Later)

**For New Orders**:
- ‚ùå NOT tax deductible for payor
- ‚ùå NOT taxable income for recipient
- üí° Results in lower payment amounts

**Example Impact**:
```
Old Law: Pay $3,000 (deduct it) = $2,100 cost
New Law: Pay $2,100 (no deduction) = $2,100 cost
Recipient gets same after-tax amount
```

### Pre-2019 Orders

**Keep Old Tax Treatment If**:
- Divorce finalized before 2019
- Don't modify amount substantially
- Don't change to non-modifiable

**Warning**: Major modifications may trigger new tax rules!

### Tax-Smart Strategies

**Instead of Monthly Payments**:
- Larger property share

- More retirement assets
- Lump sum buyout

**Calculate True Cost**:
- Factor your tax bracket
- Consider recipient's taxes
- Look at total family tax
- May affect amount agreed
