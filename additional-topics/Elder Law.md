## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: When should I consider guardianship for my elderly parent?**
A: Only after trying less restrictive alternatives like POA, supported decision-making, or limited assistance. Guardianship is last resort when person cannot make safe decisions and won't accept help.

**Q: Can I pay myself for caring for my elderly parent?**
A: Yes, through proper caregiver agreement at fair market rates. Document everything for Medicaid lookback period and tax purposes.

**Q: What's the difference between guardianship and conservatorship?**
A: Guardianship covers personal/medical decisions; conservatorship covers financial matters. Person may need one, both, or neither depending on capacity.

A: Set up account alerts, limit access, educate about scams, consider trusted contact person at financial institutions, monitor regularly.
