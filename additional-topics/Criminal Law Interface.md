## = Parallel Proceedings Management

### Fifth Amendment Considerations

#### When to Assert

#### Strategic Options
1. **Stay family court proceedings**
   - Protects against self-incrimination
   - May delay resolution
   - Court discretion to grant/deny

2. **Limited participation**
   - Appear but invoke Fifth Amendment
   - Submit to court orders
   - No testimonial evidence

3. **Immunity negotiations**
   - Use immunity rare in state court
   - Informal agreements possible
   - Coordinate with criminal counsel

### Evidence Coordination
- **Police reports**: Public records once filed
- **DCS records**: Confidential but discoverable
- **Victim interviews**: Multiple statements problematic
- **Medical records**: HIPAA considerations
- **Photographs**: Chain of custody issues
