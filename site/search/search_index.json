Frequently Asked Questions","text":"<p>Q: When should I consider guardianship for my elderly parent? A: Only after trying less restrictive alternatives like POA, supported decision-making, or limited assistance. Guardianship is last resort when person cannot make safe decisions and won't accept help.</p> <p>Q: Can I pay myself for caring for my elderly parent? A: Yes, through proper caregiver agreement at fair market rates. Document everything for Medicaid lookback period and tax purposes.</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between guardianship and conservatorship? A: Guardianship covers personal/medical decisions; conservatorship covers financial matters. Person may need one, both, or neither depending on capacity.</p> <p>Q: How can I protect my elderly parent from scams? A: Set up account alerts, limit access, educate about scams, consider trusted contact person at financial institutions, monitor regularly.</p> <p>Q: When does someone lack capacity to sign legal documents? A: When they cannot understand the nature and consequences of their actions. Different standards apply for different documents. Medical evaluation often needed.</p> <p>Q: Can nursing homes require arbitration agreements? A: They can request but cannot require as condition of admission for Medicare/Medicaid residents. Read carefully before signing.</p> <p>Q: How far back does Medicaid look for asset transfers? A: Five years from application date (lookback period). Transfers during this time may create penalty periods delaying eligibility.</p>","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#related-topics","title":"\ud83d\udd17 Related Topics","text":"<ul> <li>[[Estate Planning]] - Wills, trusts, and probate</li> <li>[[Financial Issues]] - Asset protection and exploitation</li> <li>[[Special Circumstances]] - Elder divorce and gray divorce</li> <li>[[Domestic Violence]] - Elder abuse specifics</li> <li>[[Court Procedures]] - Guardianship/conservatorship process</li> <li>[[Tax Considerations]] - Elder-specific tax issues</li> <li>[[Property Division]] - Late-life divorce considerations</li> </ul>","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#additional-resources","title":"\ud83d\udcda Additional Resources","text":"","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#government-agencies","title":"Government Agencies","text":"<ul> <li>Adult Protective Services</li> <li>Arizona Long Term Care Ombudsman</li> <li>AHCCCS (Arizona Medicaid)</li> <li>Social Security Administration</li> <li>Medicare</li> </ul>","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#legal-resources","title":"Legal Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Arizona Elder Law Attorneys</li> <li>State Bar Elder Law Section</li> <li>Legal Aid Organizations</li> <li>Pro Bono Programs</li> </ul>","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#support-organizations","title":"Support Organizations","text":"<ul> <li>Area Agency on Aging</li> <li>Alzheimer's Association Desert Southwest</li> <li>AARP Arizona</li> <li>Arizona Caregiver Coalition</li> </ul>","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#educational-resources","title":"Educational Resources","text":"<ul> <li>National Institute on Aging</li> <li>ElderCare Locator</li> <li>National Council on Aging</li> <li>Family Caregiver Alliance</li> </ul>","tags":["elder-law","elder-abuse","guardianship","conservatorship","arizona-family-law","advance-directives","power-of-attorney","long-term-care","medicaid-planning","elder-rights"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Elder%20Law/#recent-updates","title":"\ud83d\udcc5 Recent Updates","text":"<ul> <li>2023: Updated ALTCS income/asset limits</li> <li>2024: Enhanced APS investigation procedures</li> <li>2024: New supported decision-making legislation proposed</li> <li>2024: Revised professional guardian certification requirements</li> </ul> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f Practice Note: Elder law involves complex interactions between healthcare, finances, family dynamics, and legal protections.

Frequently Asked Questions","text":"<p>Q: What happens if I don't comply with mandatory disclosure? A: Courts can impose sanctions including attorney fees, evidence preclusion, or adverse inferences against non-compliant parties.</p> <p>Q: Can I refuse to answer discovery based on privacy? A: Privacy alone rarely justifies refusal. You need a specific privilege or can seek a protective order for truly sensitive information.</p> <p>Q: How do I preserve text messages for discovery? A: Screenshot conversations immediately, backup your phone, avoid deleting anything, and consider professional extraction if extensive.</p> <p>Q: Are social media posts discoverable? A: Yes, social media content is generally discoverable if relevant to the case, even if accounts are \"private.\"</p> <p>Q: What if the other party destroys evidence? A: Document the destruction, file a spoliation motion, and seek sanctions including adverse inferences or default judgment.</p> <p>Q: Can I record conversations with my spouse? A: Arizona allows one-party consent recording, but federal law may apply to interstate calls, and admissibility varies.</p> <p>Q: How much do experts typically cost? A: Experts range from $200-800/hour depending on specialty, with total costs often $5,000-25,000+ per expert.</p> <p>Q: What's the deadline for discovery responses? A: Generally 40 days for initial disclosure and 30 days for interrogatories and document requests, with some exceptions.</p>","tags":["evidence","discovery","electronic-evidence","expert-witnesses","arizona-family-law","depositions","interrogatories","subpoenas","trial-preparation","forensics"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Evidence%20and%20Discovery/#related-topics","title":"\ud83d\udd17 Related Topics","text":"<ul> <li>[[Court Procedures]] - Overall procedures</li> <li>[[Financial Issues]] - Financial discovery</li> <li>[[Child Custody]] - Custody evaluations</li> <li>[[Property Division]] - Asset discovery</li> <li>[[Spousal Maintenance]] - Income discovery</li> <li>[[Appeals]] - Preserving error</li> <li>[[Special Circumstances]] - Complex cases</li> </ul>","tags":["evidence","discovery","electronic-evidence","expert-witnesses","arizona-family-law","depositions","interrogatories","subpoenas","trial-preparation","forensics"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Evidence%20and%20Discovery/#additional-resources","title":"\ud83d\udcda Additional Resources","text":"","tags":["evidence","discovery","electronic-evidence","expert-witnesses","arizona-family-law","depositions","interrogatories","subpoenas","trial-preparation","forensics"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Evidence%20and%20Discovery/#court-resources","title":"Court Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Arizona Rules of Family Law Procedure</li> <li>Arizona Rules of Evidence</li> <li>Maricopa County Family Court</li> <li>Local Rule Forms</li> </ul>","tags":["evidence","discovery","electronic-evidence","expert-witnesses","arizona-family-law","depositions","interrogatories","subpoenas","trial-preparation","forensics"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Evidence%20and%20Discovery/#professional-resources","title":"Professional Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Arizona Forensic Accountants</li> <li>Computer Forensics Experts</li> <li>Court Reporter Directory</li> <li>Process Server Association</li> </ul>","tags":["evidence","discovery","electronic-evidence","expert-witnesses","arizona-family-law","depositions","interrogatories","subpoenas","trial-preparation","forensics"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Evidence%20and%20Discovery/#practice-guides","title":"Practice Guides","text":"<ul> <li>Family Law Discovery Handbook</li> <li>Electronic Evidence Guide</li> <li>Expert Witness Directory</li> <li>Sedona Conference Guidelines</li> </ul>","tags":["evidence","discovery","electronic-evidence","expert-witnesses","arizona-family-law","depositions","interrogatories","subpoenas","trial-preparation","forensics"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Evidence%20and%20Discovery/#recent-updates","title":"\ud83d\udcc5 Recent Updates","text":"<ul> <li>2024: New electronic signature rules for discovery responses</li> <li>2023: Updated social media authentication requirements</li> <li>2023: Revised expert disclosure deadlines</li> <li>2022: Enhanced electronic discovery protocols post-pandemic</li> </ul> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f Practice Warning: Discovery violations can result in severe sanctions including case dismissal or default judgment.

A: No waiting period in Arizona. You can get married immediately after receiving your license.</p> <p>Q: Can my friend perform our wedding ceremony? A: Yes, with one-day special authorization from Superior Court for a $75 fee.</p> <p>Q: Is a prenuptial agreement worth it? A: Depends on your situation. Valuable for significant assets, business owners, second marriages, or inheritance protection.</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between annulment and divorce?

Frequently Asked Questions","text":"<p>Q: Can my military spouse delay our divorce indefinitely? A: No. While SCRA provides stays, they're not indefinite. Courts balance service member rights with spouse's need to proceed.</p> <p>Q: Will my same-sex marriage be recognized if we move states? A: Yes, all states must recognize valid same-sex marriages. However, documentation and advance planning recommended.</p> <p>Q: How are stock options divided in high-asset divorces? A: Various methods exist including immediate buyout, deferred distribution, or percentage sharing, considering vesting and tax impacts.</p> <p>Q: Can I use my spouse's immigration status against them in custody? A: Immigration status alone is not determinative. Courts focus on best interests of child and actual parenting capacity.</p> <p>Q: Do religious divorce requirements affect civil proceedings? A: Civil courts cannot enforce religious requirements but may consider religious agreements as contracts if properly drafted.</p> <p>Q: How is disability considered in custody decisions? A: Disability alone cannot determine custody. Courts must consider actual parenting capacity with reasonable accommodations.</p> <p>Q: Can I protect my privacy during a high-profile divorce? A: Various tools available including sealing orders, private judging, and protective orders, balanced against public interest.</p>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#related-topics","title":"\ud83d\udd17 Related Topics","text":"<ul> <li>[[Property Division]] - Complex asset division strategies</li> <li>[[Child Custody]] - Special custody considerations</li> <li>[[Interstate and International]] - Multi-jurisdictional issues</li> <li>[[Tax Considerations]] - High-asset tax planning</li> <li>[[Legal Representation]] - Finding specialized counsel</li> <li>[[Alternative Dispute Resolution]] - Private resolution options</li> <li>[[Appeals]] - Challenging special circumstance rulings</li> <li>[[Domestic Violence]] - Emergency procedures</li> </ul>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#additional-resources","title":"\ud83d\udcda Additional Resources","text":"","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#military-resources","title":"Military Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Military OneSource</li> <li>Defense Finance and Accounting Service</li> <li>Armed Forces Legal Assistance</li> <li>Veterans Affairs Benefits</li> </ul>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#lgbtq-resources","title":"LGBTQ+ Resources","text":"<ul> <li>National Center for Lesbian Rights</li> <li>Lambda Legal</li> <li>Family Equality Council</li> <li>GLBTQ Legal Advocates &amp; Defenders</li> </ul>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#high-asset-resources","title":"High-Asset Resources","text":"<ul> <li>American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers</li> <li>Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts</li> <li>Business Valuation Resources</li> <li>National Association of Forensic Accountants</li> </ul>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#disability-resources","title":"Disability Resources","text":"<ul> <li>National Disability Rights Network</li> <li>ADA National Network</li> <li>The Arc</li> <li>Special Needs Alliance</li> </ul>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#international-resources","title":"International Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Hague Conference</li> <li>International Academy of Family Lawyers</li> <li>U.S. State Department - Family Matters</li> <li>International Social Service</li> </ul>","tags":["military-divorce","high-asset-divorce","same-sex-marriage","celebrity-divorce","arizona-family-law","LGBTQ-family-law","religious-divorce","international-families","disability-issues","incarcerated-parents"]},{"location":"additional-topics/Special%20Circumstances/#recent-updates","title":"\ud83d\udcc5 Recent Updates","text":"<ul> <li>2023: Expanded military spouse protections</li> <li>2024: Updated LGBTQ+ parenting presumptions</li> <li>2024: Enhanced international custody cooperation</li> <li>2024: Revised disability accommodation requirements</li> </ul> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f Practice Note: Special circumstances in family law require specialized expertise and creative problem-solving.

A: No, but it's mandatory for custody and parenting time disputes unless exempted for domestic violence or other factors.</p> <p>Q: Can agreements reached in mediation be changed? A: Yes, through the normal modification process if there's a substantial change in circumstances.</p> <p>Q: What happens if collaborative divorce fails? A: Both attorneys must withdraw, and parties must hire new counsel for litigation.</p> <p>Q: Is arbitration faster than going to trial? A: Usually yes, as you can schedule around the arbitrator's availability rather than wait for court dates.</p> <p>Q: Are ADR proceedings public record? A: No, most ADR processes are confidential, though final agreements filed with the court become public.</p>","tags":["mediation","collaborative-law","arbitration","settlement","conciliation-court","private-judging","adr","arizona-family-law"]},{"location":"procedures/Alternative%20Dispute%20Resolution/#related-topics","title":"\ud83d\udd17 Related Topics","text":"<ul> <li>[[Court Procedures]] - Traditional litigation process</li> <li>[[Child Custody]] - Custody mediation specifics</li> <li>[[Financial Issues]] - Financial neutral roles</li> <li>[[Domestic Violence]] - ADR exemptions and modifications</li> <li>[[Property Division]] - Arbitration of complex assets</li> <li>[[Legal Representation]] - Collaborative attorney requirements</li> </ul>","tags":["mediation","collaborative-law","arbitration","settlement","conciliation-court","private-judging","adr","arizona-family-law"]},{"location":"procedures/Alternative%20Dispute%20Resolution/#additional-resources","title":"\ud83d\udcda Additional Resources","text":"","tags":["mediation","collaborative-law","arbitration","settlement","conciliation-court","private-judging","adr","arizona-family-law"]},{"location":"procedures/Alternative%20Dispute%20Resolution/#adr-organizations","title":"ADR Organizations","text":"<ul> <li>Arizona Dispute Resolution Association</li> <li>International Academy of Collaborative Professionals</li> <li>American Arbitration Association</li> </ul>","tags":["mediation","collaborative-law","arbitration","settlement","conciliation-court","private-judging","adr","arizona-family-law"]},{"location":"procedures/Alternative%20Dispute%20Resolution/#court-adr-programs","title":"Court ADR Programs","text":"<ul> <li>Maricopa County Conciliation Court</li> <li>Pima County Mediation</li> <li>Court ADR Resources</li> </ul>","tags":["mediation","collaborative-law","arbitration","settlement","conciliation-court","private-judging","adr","arizona-family-law"]},{"location":"procedures/Alternative%20Dispute%20Resolution/#training-and-certification","title":"Training and Certification","text":"<ul> <li>State Bar ADR Section</li> <li>Mediation Training Institute</li> <li>Collaborative Divorce Training</li> </ul>","tags":["mediation","collaborative-law","arbitration","settlement","conciliation-court","private-judging","adr","arizona-family-law"]},{"location":"procedures/Alternative%20Dispute%20Resolution/#recent-updates","title":"\ud83d\udcc5 Recent Updates","text":"<ul> <li>2023: Expanded parenting coordinator authority</li> <li>2024: New collaborative law participation agreement requirements</li> <li>2024: Updated mediator qualification standards</li> </ul> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f Practice Note: ADR success depends heavily on good faith participation and realistic expectations.

A: Generally no for personal divorce. Only tax advice portions and business-related legal fees remain deductible.</p> <p>Q: How is child support treated for taxes? A: Not deductible by payor, not income to recipient. No tax consequences either direction.</p> <p>Q: Can I claim the children on my taxes? A: The custodial parent (more overnights) has the default right. Can be assigned to non-custodial parent with Form 8332.</p> <p>Q: What happens to our joint tax debt?
