# Annulment in Arizona

## 🔍 At a Glance

**Quick Summary**: An annulment legally declares that a marriage never existed, unlike divorce which ends a valid marriage. Arizona recognizes both void marriages (automatically invalid) and voidable marriages (valid until annulled).

**Who This Affects**: People in marriages that were illegal from the start, involved fraud or coercion, or have other serious defects. Much rarer than divorce.

**Key Point**: Annulment has strict requirements and time limits. Most unhappy marriages don't qualify - they need divorce instead.

## ❓ Common Questions

### Can I get an annulment if we never had sex?

**Maybe** - but only if:
- Incapacity was concealed before marriage
- It's permanent
- You separated immediately upon discovery
- You file within time limits

Just choosing not to have sex isn't grounds.

**Possibly** - if you were so intoxicated you couldn't understand you were getting married. But:
- Must be extreme intoxication
- Staying married after = ratification
- Hard to prove
- Need witnesses/evidence

### Is annulment easier than divorce?

**No** - it's usually harder because:
- Must prove specific grounds
- Higher burden of proof
- Time limits apply
- Most marriages don't qualify

Divorce is no-fault and simpler.

### What about religious annulment?

**Separate process**:
- Legal annulment ≠ religious annulment
- Need both for full dissolution
- Different requirements
- Consult religious authority

### How long does annulment take?

**Varies**:
- Uncontested: 2-3 months
- Contested: 6-12 months
- No 60-day waiting period
- Depends on court schedule

### Can I remarry immediately?

**After court order**:
- Yes, once decree entered
- No waiting period
- Get certified copy
- Marriage never existed

### What if spouse won't agree?

**Doesn't matter if**:
- You prove grounds
- Court makes decision
- They can contest/defend
- But can't block if proven

### Is fraud hard to prove?

**Yes** - must show:
- Material misrepresentation
- Relied on it

Not just being unhappy with spouse.
