# Property Division in Arizona Divorce

## üîç At a Glance

**Quick Summary**: Arizona is a community property state, meaning most assets and debts acquired during marriage belong equally to both spouses. The court divides property equitably (fairly), which usually means 50/50 but can vary based on circumstances.

**Who This Affects**: Anyone divorcing in Arizona who owns property, has debts, or acquired assets during marriage.

**Key Principle**: It doesn't matter whose name is on the title or account - if acquired during marriage, it's likely community property.

## ‚ö° Key Takeaways

- ‚úÖ Property acquired during marriage is presumed community (50/50)
- ‚úÖ Separate property remains with original owner
- ‚úÖ Debts incurred during marriage are also divided
- ‚úÖ "Equitable" means fair, not always equal
- ‚úÖ Hiding assets has serious consequences
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed assets require careful tracing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some property can't be divided and must be sold
