# Adoption

## üîç Quick Overview
Adoption creates a permanent legal parent-child relationship between individuals not biologically related. Arizona law provides multiple pathways for adoption while prioritizing child welfare and ensuring proper consent or termination of biological parent rights. The process varies significantly based on the type of adoption, relationship of parties, and whether the child is from Arizona, another state, or internationally.
