**‚ö†Ô∏è Practice Note**: Appeals are expensive, time-consuming, and success rates are low. The broad discretion afforded trial courts in family law matters makes reversal difficult. Consider whether modification proceedings might achieve your goals more efficiently. If pursuing appeal, strict compliance with procedural rules is essential - missed deadlines are fatal and cannot be cured.
