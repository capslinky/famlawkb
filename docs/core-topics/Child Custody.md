# Child Custody (Legal Decision-Making) in Arizona

## üîç At a Glance

**Quick Summary**: Arizona uses "legal decision-making" instead of "custody" to emphasize both parents' roles. Courts focus on the child's best interests, with a preference for joint decision-making unless it would harm the child.

**Who This Affects**: All parents going through divorce, separation, or paternity cases with minor children under 18.

**Typical Timeline**:
- Temporary orders: 30-60 days
- Final orders: 6-12 months
- Modifications: 3-6 months

## ‚ö° Key Takeaways

- ‚úÖ Both parents have equal rights - no gender preference
- ‚úÖ Joint custody is preferred but not guaranteed
- ‚úÖ "Best interests" determined by specific factors
- ‚úÖ Children's wishes considered but not controlling
- ‚úÖ Domestic violence creates presumption against joint custody
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must wait 1 year to modify (except emergencies)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Parenting time is separate from decision-making
