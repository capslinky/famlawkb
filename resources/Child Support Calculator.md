# Arizona Child Support Calculator Guide

## üîç At a Glance

**Quick Summary**: Arizona uses an "Income Shares Model" that considers both parents' incomes, parenting time, and specific expenses. This guide walks you through using the official calculator.

**Official Calculator**: [Arizona Supreme Court Calculator](https://www.azcourts.gov/familylaw/2022-Child-Support-Calculator)

**Average Support Amounts** (2024):
- 1 child: $400-800/month
- 2 children: $600-1,200/month
- 3 children: $800-1,500/month

## ‚ö° Key Points

- ‚úÖ Based on both parents' gross incomes
- ‚úÖ Adjusted for parenting time (days with each parent)
- ‚úÖ Includes health insurance and childcare
- ‚úÖ Calculator result is presumptively correct
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Court can deviate only with good cause
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Self-employment income requires adjustments

## üìã Before You Start

Gather these documents:

- [ ] Last 3 pay stubs (both parents)
- [ ] Last year's tax return
- [ ] Health insurance costs (children's portion)
- [ ] Childcare/daycare receipts

## üßÆ Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Calculate Gross Income

**Include ALL Income**:
- ‚úÖ Wages, salary, tips
- ‚úÖ Bonuses and commissions
- ‚úÖ Self-employment income
- ‚úÖ Rental income
- ‚úÖ Investment income
- ‚úÖ Unemployment benefits

**Don't Include**:

### Step 2: Determine Parenting Time

Count annual overnights with each parent:

| Parenting Time | Days/Year | Adjustment |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| No overnights | 0-57 | 0% |
| Every other weekend | 58-87 | 10% reduction |
| Extended weekends | 88-115 | 20% reduction |
| 35% time | 116-142 | 30% reduction |
| Near equal (40%+) | 143+ | Special calculation |

### Step 3: Add Additional Expenses

**Health Insurance**:
- Children's portion only
- Total premium √ó (# kids / total covered)
- Paid by either parent

**Childcare Costs**:
- Work-related only
- Actual monthly cost
- Summer care included
- After-school programs

**Extraordinary Expenses**:
- Special needs costs
- Private school (if agreed)
- Travel for parenting time

### Step 4: Use the Calculator

1. Go to [Official Calculator](https://www.azcourts.gov/familylaw/2022-Child-Support-Calculator)
2. Enter information for both parents
3. Input children's ages
4. Add expenses
5. Calculate result

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Basic Support Amount

The calculator shows:
- **Combined Adjusted Gross Income**: Both parents' total
- **Basic Support Obligation**: From guidelines table
- **Proportionate Share**: Each parent's percentage

### Adjustments Applied

1. **Parenting Time Credit**: Reduces obligation
2. **Additional Expenses**: Added to basic amount
3. **Final Amount**: Monthly payment

### Self-Support Reserve

Ensures paying parent keeps minimum income:
- 2024: $1,300/month
- Support reduced if necessary
- Never below $50/month minimum

## üí∞ Income Considerations

### Self-Employment Income

**Add Back**:
- Depreciation
- Home office deduction
- Vehicle expenses (personal portion)
- Entertainment expenses
- Excessive advertising

**Calculation**:
```
Gross Receipts
- Legitimate Business Expenses
+ Add-backs
= Income for Support
```

### Unemployment/Underemployment

**Court May Impute Income If**:
- Voluntary unemployment
- Working below capacity
- No legitimate reason

**Imputed Amount Based On**:
- Work history
- Education level
- Local job market
- Minimum wage at minimum

### Overtime and Bonuses

**Regular Overtime**: Usually included
**Sporadic Overtime**: May be averaged
**Annual Bonuses**: Averaged over time
**One-time Bonuses**: Court discretion

## üìà Common Scenarios

### 50/50 Parenting Time

With equal time (182.5 days each):
1. Calculate each parent's obligation
2. Higher earner pays difference
3. Still share additional expenses

**Example**:
- Parent A owes: $800
- Parent B owes: $500
- Parent A pays Parent B: $300

### Primary Parent Unemployed

- Support still calculated
- May impute minimum wage
- Consider childcare savings
- Temporary orders possible

### Multiple Children, Different Parents

- Calculate each order separately
- Deduct prior orders from income
- Older orders have priority
- Total can't exceed limits

## ‚öñÔ∏è Deviation Factors

Courts can deviate from calculator if:

**Child-Related**:
- Extraordinary medical expenses
- Special needs
- Older child's greater costs
- Travel expenses for parenting time

**Parent-Related**:
- Extreme financial hardship
- Extraordinary income
- Assets generating no income
- Second family obligations

**Required Findings**:
1. Calculator amount
2. Deviation amount
3. Specific reasons
4. Best interests analysis

## üîÑ When to Recalculate

**Review Support When**:
- Income changes 15%+
- Parenting time changes
- Child care ends
- Insurance changes
- Every 3 years

**Modification Process**:
1. Recalculate support
2. Compare to current order
3. If 15%+ different, file petition
4. Effective date: Filing/service
