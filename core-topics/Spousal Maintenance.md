# Spousal Maintenance (Alimony)

## 🔍 At a Glance

**Quick Summary**: Spousal maintenance (alimony) provides financial support from one spouse to another after divorce. Arizona adopted spousal maintenance guidelines in 2023 that provide formulas for amount and duration, though judges can deviate.

**Who This Affects**: Lower-earning spouses who can't meet reasonable needs through property or employment. Common after long marriages or when one spouse sacrificed career for family.

**Key Point**: Must first prove eligibility under A.R.S. § 25-319, then court applies guidelines or deviates with findings.

## ⚡ Key Takeaways

- ✅ Must prove eligibility before amount/duration
- 📊 **NEW 2023**: Guidelines provide formulas for amount and duration
- 💰 Guideline amount: Based on income difference and marriage length
- ⏱️ Guideline duration: 30-50% of marriage length (varies by years)
- ⚠️ Tax rules changed in 2019 (not deductible)
- ⚠️ Remarriage ends it automatically
- 🔄 Can be modified if circumstances change
- 📝 Court can deviate from guidelines with written findings

## 📊 How Much & How Long?

### 2023 Arizona Spousal Maintenance Guidelines

**Guideline Calculator Formula**:

**Step 1: Calculate Monthly Amount**
```
Combined Monthly Income × Applicable Percentage
- Lower Earner's Monthly Income
= Preliminary Maintenance Amount

Then apply range: 15% to 20% of income difference
```

**Marriage Length Percentages**:
- 0-3 years: Not applicable (rarely awarded)
- 3-5 years: 31-32%
- 5-10 years: 33-35%
- 10-15 years: 36-38%
- 15-20 years: 39-41%
- 20+ years: 42-44%

**Step 2: Duration Formula**
```
Marriage Length × Duration Percentage = Months of Support
```

**Duration Percentages by Length**:
- 0-3 years: 20-30%
- 3-5 years: 30-35%
- 5-10 years: 35-40%
- 10-15 years: 40-45%
- 15-20 years: 45-50%
- 20+ years: 50%+ or indefinite

### 2023 Guideline Examples

**Example with Guidelines**:
```
Marriage: 12 years
Husband's Income: $8,000/month
Wife's Income: $3,000/month
No minor children

Step 1 - Amount:
Combined income: $11,000
Applicable %: 37% (for 12-year marriage)
$11,000 × 0.37 = $4,070
$4,070 - $3,000 = $1,070/month

Step 2 - Duration:
12 years × 42% = 5 years (60 months)

Guideline Result: $1,070/month for 5 years
```

### Deviation Factors

**Court Can Deviate If**:
- Unusual financial needs
- Health issues
- Property division affects
- Earning capacity disparities
- Domestic violence history
- Other factors under A.R.S. § 25-319

### Real Examples with 2023 Guidelines

**Example 1: Short Marriage**
```
Married: 4 years
Wife: Teacher $3,333/month
Husband: Engineer $7,500/month
No kids

Guideline Calculation:
Combined: $10,833 × 31.5% = $3,412
$3,412 - $3,333 = $79 (too low)
Minimum 15% of difference: ($7,500-$3,333) × 0.15 = $625
Duration: 4 years × 32% = 1.3 years (16 months)

Result: $625/month for 16 months
```

**Example 2: Long Marriage**
```
Married: 25 years
Wife: Homemaker $0/month
Husband: Doctor $16,667/month
Kids grown

Guideline Calculation:
Combined: $16,667 × 43% = $7,167
$7,167 - $0 = $7,167/month
Duration: 25 years × 50%+ = Indefinite

Result: $7,167/month indefinitely
(Court may deviate based on assets received)
```

### The A.R.S. § 25-319(B) Factors

**Guidelines are Starting Point - Court Also Considers**:

1. **Standard of living** during marriage

9. **Financial resources** after property division
10. **Time needed** for education/training
11. **Excessive expenditures** or destruction
12. **Cost of health insurance**
13. **Actual damages** from criminal conduct

- Debt documentation

### Step 3: Temporary Support

**Trial (10% of cases)**:

## 💵 Tax Impact

### Current Rules (2019 & Later)

**For New Orders**:
- ❌ NOT tax deductible for payor
- ❌ NOT taxable income for recipient
- 💡 Results in lower payment amounts

**Example Impact**:
```
Old Law (pre-2019): 
Pay $3,000 (deduct it) = $2,100 actual cost
Recipient pays tax on $3,000

Current Law (2019+):
Pay $3,000 (no deduction) = $3,000 actual cost
Recipient receives $3,000 tax-free

Net result: Higher cost to payor, same benefit to recipient
```

### Pre-2019 Orders

**Keep Old Tax Treatment If**:
- Divorce finalized before 2019
- Don't modify amount substantially
- Don't change to non-modifiable

**Warning**: Major modifications may trigger new tax rules!

### Tax-Smart Strategies

**Instead of Monthly Payments**:
- Larger property share
- Keep the house
- More retirement assets
- Lump sum buyout
- Note: Guidelines don't apply to property division

**Calculate True Cost**:
- Factor your tax bracket
- Consider recipient's taxes
- Look at total family tax
- May affect amount agreed

## 🔄 Modifying Support

4. Discovery/negotiations
