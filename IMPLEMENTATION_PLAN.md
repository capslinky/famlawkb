## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### **Frontend**
```yaml
Framework: Next.js 14
Language: TypeScript 5.0
Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4
Components: Radix UI + Custom Library
State: Zustand + React Query
Forms: React Hook Form + Zod
Animation: Framer Motion
Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
```

#### **Backend Services**
```yaml
API: Next.js API Routes
Database: PostgreSQL 15 + Prisma ORM
Cache: Redis 7
Storage: AWS S3
Search: Algolia
Analytics: PostHog + Google Analytics 4
Monitoring: Sentry + Datadog
```

#### **Infrastructure**
```yaml
Hosting: Vercel Pro
CDN: CloudFlare
Domain: Route 53
SSL: Let's Encrypt
Backup: AWS Backup
CI/CD: GitHub Actions
```

### Architecture Decisions

#### **ADR-001: Microservices for Calculators**
**Decision:** Implement calculators as isolated microservices
**Rationale:** Enables independent scaling and updates without affecting main application
**Consequences:** Additional complexity, requires API gateway

#### **ADR-002: Event-Driven Progress Tracking**
**Decision:** Use event sourcing for user progress
**Rationale:** Provides complete audit trail and enables replay
**Consequences:** Increased storage requirements, eventual consistency

#### **ADR-003: Edge Computing for Crisis Detection**
**Decision:** Deploy crisis keyword detection at edge
**Rationale:** Reduces latency for emergency responses
**Consequences:** Requires edge function deployment strategy
