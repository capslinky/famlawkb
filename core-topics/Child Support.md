## üí∞ How Support is Calculated

### Income Shares Model

Arizona uses the "Income Shares Model":
1. Combine both parents' incomes
2. Determine basic support from guidelines table
3. Divide proportionally by income
4. Adjust for parenting time
5. Add health insurance and childcare

### Quick Calculation Steps

**Step 1: Gross Monthly Income**
```
Parent A: $5,000
Parent B: $3,000
Combined: $8,000
```

**Step 2: Basic Support Amount**
```
1 child at $8,000 combined = $1,102
(from guidelines table)
```

**Step 3: Proportionate Share**
```
Parent A: 62.5% = $689
Parent B: 37.5% = $413
```

**Step 4: Parenting Time Adjustment**
- More time = lower payment
- Less time = higher payment

### Additional Costs Added

**Always Included**:
- Medical/dental insurance (children's portion)
- Work-related childcare
- Court-ordered expenses
